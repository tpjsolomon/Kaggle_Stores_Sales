There are several data files available:
train.csv - the training data contains a time series of features: "date", "store_nbr" (identifies the store at which the products are sold), "family" (identifies the type of product sold), "onpromotion" (the total number of items in a product family that were being promoted at a store at a given date), and target "sales" (the total sales for a product family at a particular store at a given date). 
test.csv - The test data has the same features as the training data. I want to predict the target "sales" for the dates in this file. The dates in the test data are for the 15 days after the last date in the training data.
stores.csv - metadata for each "store_nbr", including "city", "state", "type", and "cluster" (cluster is a grouping of similar stores).
oil.csv - includes daily oil price values ("dcoilwtico") on each "date" during both the train and test data timeframes. (Ecuador is an oil-dependent country whose economic health is highly vulnerable to shocks in oil prices.)
holidays_events.csv - metadata for important dates ("date"), including "type", "locale", "locale_name", "description, and "transferred". NOTE: the "transferred" column indicates that a holiday that officially falls on that calendar day but was moved to another date by the government. The "date" that the holiday was actually celebrated is indicated when "type" = Transfer. When "type" = Bridge this means that extra days that are added to a holiday (e.g., to extend the break across a long weekend). When "type" = Additional this means that holidays are days added to a regular calendar holiday.
transactions.csv - contains "date", "store_nbr", and "transactions" (the number of transactions on that date).
